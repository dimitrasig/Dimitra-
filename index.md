What is chronic pain?
========================================================
Chronic pain is the persisting pain that has no biological value and lasts longer than the typical healing time (more than 6 months)  (Brook et al., 2008).

Opioid drugs are medications that are effective in relieving many types of pain, including chronic pain. They are classified as narcotics and they can be dangerous when abused.
e.g. morphine (treats pain that follows surgery and cancer)
(Krebs et al., 2018)

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a common type of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and thoughts by encouraging patients to change destructive behavior patterns (Dobson & Dozois, 2019).


Hypotheses
========================================================
Null hypothesis: Cognitive behavioral therapy is not correlated with chronic pain treatment

Alternative hypothesis: Cognitive behavioral therapy is correlated with chronic pain treatment



Null hypothesis: Opioid drug treatment is not correlated with chronic pain treatment

Alternative hypothesis: Opioid drug treatment is correlated with chronic pain treatment


Methods
========================================================
We will use Google Trends as a base for collecting data and we will follow some steps:

1. We'll compare the words "Cognitive behavioral therapy" and "chronic pain treatment" and seek for a correlation between them

2. We'll compare the searching of key words "Opioid drug treatment" and "chronic pain treatment" and seek for a correlation between them 


Statistical analyses
========================================================

As a statistical criteria, we'll use Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson r) in both of our analyses
